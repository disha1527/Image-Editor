<h1>Image Editor</h1>

<p>To build an Image Editor using HTML CSS & JavaScript, you need to 
create three files: HTML, CSS & JavaScript file.</p>

<p>In this project (Image Editor in JavaScript), as youâ€™ve seen in the preview image, users can apply different filters to their 
image like grayscale, inversion, saturation, and adjust the image brightness. 
Additionally, users can also rotate or flip the images and save their edited images.</p>
